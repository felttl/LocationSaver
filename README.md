- very usefull for police when a crimes has been commited, it's a "alibi" 

## utilisation des donn√©es - Data usage

all data save on your device are accessible to you only and we are not collecting data from you, also your data are saved on your device as a json file
with a specific structure [see section here](#structure-des-fichiers---files-structure)

## structure des fichiers - files structure

<!-- json file of course but bad formatting we also use js formatting -->
```js
{
  systemUserName: "deviceNameHere",
  profile: "ObjectUserUnixSysProfile",
  startDate: "dateStampHere",
  endDate: "dateStampHere",
  data: [
    {
      date: "dateStampHere",
      id: UDouble,
      etc...      
    }
  ]
}
```
